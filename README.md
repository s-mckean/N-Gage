The game starts off with the player on the middle island. The player jumped from island to island. Certain islands have a generator on it that give power to the force field. The destroyed the force field the player need to kill all the enemies that are one that specific island. When all the generator is destroyed, the force field will disappear, and the dragon is released. The player at this point must kill the dragon to win the game.
The dragon attacks the player but gathering energy from its surrounding and concentrate it into a plasma fireball. When the dragon shoots the plasma fireball, the fireball will travel in the direction of the player. The fireball itself does big damage to the player and the explosion of the fireball can also hurt the player but to a lesser degree. The player either lose the game by dying or win the game by killing the dragon at the end. For player control, play the tutorial; to shoot press the "space bar" key.
