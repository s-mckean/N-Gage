  The game starts off with the player on the middle island. The player will have to jump from island to island. Certain islands have a generator on it that feed power to the force field. To destroy the force field, the player needs to kill all the enemies that are one that specific island. When all the generators are destroyed, the force field will disappear, and the dragon will be released. 
  The dragon will periodically gather energy to unleash his plasma fireball at the player. When the dragon shoots the plasma fireball, the fireball will travel in the direction of the player. The fireball itself does significant damage to the player, and the explosion of the fireball can also hurt the player but to a lesser degree. The player must either lose the game by dying or win the game by killing the dragon at the end.  To learn player controls, play the tutorial; to shoot press the "space bar" key.
