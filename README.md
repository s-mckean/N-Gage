  The game starts off with the player on the middle island. The player will have to jump from island to island. Certain islands have a generator on it that feed power to the force field. To destroy the force field, the player needs to kill all the enemies that are on that specific island. When all the generators are destroyed the force field will disappear, and the dragon will be released. 
  The dragon will periodically gather energy to unleash his plasma fireball at the player. The fireball itself does significant damage to the player, and the explosion of the fireball hurts the player but to a lesser degree. The player must either lose the game by dying or win the game by killing the dragon.  We have a helpful tutorial to teach the games controls to the player.


To play the game you use WASD on your keyboard to move, Spacebar to jump, E keyboard Button to Boost, and Right mouse button to attack. You'll start the game on the center island with the Dragon Boss located directly above you. The Dragon won't move or attack until you destroy all the generators located on the nearby islands. After making you way to one of the generator islands you must kill all the small enemies to destroy the generator. Once all generators have been destroyed in the scene the Dragon Boss will be released and will start to attack you. You must kill the Dragon Boss to win the game.
