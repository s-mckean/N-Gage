Our game is a first person shooter with a end game boss. The Earth is nearly lost to the Great Dragon Menace. The great big ball of dirt once known as the home of humanity has been reduced to mere rock islands. Most of Earth's essence has been absorbed and all of humanity has been wiped out except you. You are the last human left and it's up to you to avenge humanity. You must stop the Dragon from draining what’s left of the planet by destroying his generators, but doing so will be no easy feat. They are guarded by the Dragons Henchmen who operate the device, and you must defeat them to destroy it. Once all the Generators have been destroyed the Great Dragon will have no choice but to face you.

To play the game you use WASD on your keyboard to move, Spacebar to jump, hold Shift to Sprint, E keyboard Button to Boost, and Left mouse button to attack. The Boost can be preformed in midair, but a cooldown is activated upon use. Jumping and Boosting is the best way to navigate your way around the scene. Falling off the islands can result in your death, but you can boost your way back up. You'll start the game on the center island with the Dragon Boss located directly above you. The Dragon won't move or attack until you destroy all the generators located on the nearby islands. After making your way to one of the generator islands you must kill all the small enemies to destroy the generator.  When all the generators are destroyed the force field will disappear, and the dragon will be released. The dragon will periodically gather energy to unleash his plasma fireball at the player. The fireball itself does significant damage to the player, and the explosion of the fireball hurts the player but to a lesser degree. The player must either lose the game by dying or win the game by killing the dragon.  We have a helpful tutorial to teach the games controls to the player.
